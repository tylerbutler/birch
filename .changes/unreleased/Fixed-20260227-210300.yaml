    Fix `:logger` forwarding always logging at info level
    `forward_to_logger()` silently discarded the log record's severity, sending every message to Erlang's `:logger` at the `info` level. Warnings, errors, and fatal messages all appeared as informational. Use the new `forward_to_beam()` handler which preserves levels correctly.
