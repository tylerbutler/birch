    Eliminate double-formatting of log messages on BEAM (#87)
    Previously, birch formatted a message string via the handler, passed it to `:logger`, and the birch formatter would try to format it again — producing garbled output with duplicate timestamps and metadata. LogRecords now pass through `:logger` intact and the formatter uses them directly.
