    Default to BEAM `:logger` on Erlang target.

    On Erlang, birch now forwards logs through OTP's `:logger` system by default instead of writing directly to the console. birch installs a `:logger` **formatter** (`format/2` callback) that applies birch's presentation (timestamps, colors, simple/fancy styles, metadata) to both birch-originated and OTP/library log events. The `:logger` handler controls output (console, file, etc.) while birch controls formatting.

    `forward_to_logger_raw()` now sends structured metadata (logger name, metadata, caller ID) to `:logger` instead of pre-formatting the message, so the formatter can reconstruct full `LogRecord` values.

    `default_handler_id` changed from `"birch"` to `"default"` to reflect the target handler. The old value is preserved as the deprecated `legacy_handler_id` constant.

    JavaScript target continues to use the console handler with colors.
