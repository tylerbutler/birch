    On Erlang, birch now uses OTP's built-in `:logger` system by default.

    Logs are routed through `:logger` instead of being written directly to the console. birch controls how log messages are formatted (timestamps, colors, metadata) while `:logger` controls where they go (console, file, etc.). This means birch-formatted output now applies to OTP and library log events too, giving you consistent formatting across your entire application.

    The `default_handler_id` constant changed from `"birch"` to `"default"`. The old value is still available as the deprecated `legacy_handler_id`.

    The JavaScript target is unchanged and continues using the console handler with colors.
