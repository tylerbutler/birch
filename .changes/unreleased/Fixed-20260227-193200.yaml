    Add exception safety to Erlang scoped context (#83)
    If `work()` panicked inside `with_scope` or `with_scoped_logger` on the Erlang target, the process dictionary was never restored — permanently corrupting scope context for OTP processes. Added `try/after` FFI helpers to guarantee cleanup. The JavaScript target already handled this correctly.
