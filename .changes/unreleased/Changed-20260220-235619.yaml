    Use BEAM formatter callback instead of handler callback for `:logger` integration

    birch plugs into `:logger` as a **formatter** rather than a **handler**. This means your existing BEAM handler configuration (console, file, etc.) stays in control of output, and birch just handles how messages look. This is a simpler, more compatible approach that works better alongside other OTP logging tools.

    See the new `install_formatter()` / `remove_formatter()` functions in `birch/erlang_logger`.
