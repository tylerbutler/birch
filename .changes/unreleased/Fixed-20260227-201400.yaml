    Fix cross-platform scope context parity
    Removed unused `_scope_highlight_keys` internal metadata that was only injected on the JavaScript target, causing behavioral divergence from the Erlang target. Also removes the `StringVal` import coupling to Gleam codegen internals in `birch_ffi.mjs`.
