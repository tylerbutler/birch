import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Cross-Platform" icon="laptop">
		Works on both **Erlang** (BEAM) and **JavaScript** targets. Same API, consistent behavior across Node.js, Deno, Bun, and browsers.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Zero-Configuration" icon="rocket">
		Just import and start logging. Sensible defaults get you started immediately with no boilerplate.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Structured Logging" icon="document">
		Attach key-value metadata to every log message. Perfect for filtering and aggregation in production.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Multiple Handlers" icon="setting">
		Console with colors, JSON for log aggregation, file with rotation, async for performance, or build your own.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```gleam
import birch as log

pub fn main() {
  // Simple logging
  log.info("Application starting")
  log.debug("Debug message")
  log.error("Something went wrong")

  // With metadata
  log.info_m("User logged in", [
    #("user_id", "123"),
    #("ip", "192.168.1.1"),
  ])
}
```

Output:
```
2024-12-26T10:30:45.123Z | INFO  | root | Application starting
2024-12-26T10:30:45.124Z | DEBUG | root | Debug message
2024-12-26T10:30:45.125Z | ERROR | root | Something went wrong
2024-12-26T10:30:45.126Z | INFO  | root | User logged in | user_id=123 ip=192.168.1.1
```

## More Highlights

- **Lazy evaluation** - Avoid expensive string formatting when logs are filtered
- **Scoped context** - Request-scoped metadata that propagates automatically
- **Log rotation** - Size-based and time-based rotation for file handlers
- **Sampling** - Probabilistic sampling for high-volume scenarios
- **Named loggers** - Organize logs by component with persistent context
